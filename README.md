Over the recent past, most parts of India have been greatly affected by floods. The nation has been underprepared for most of these situations and has hence faced great social consequences. Considering all this, we have decided focus our work on predicting, preventing and dealing with floods. 

For prediction, we are extracting relevant information mainly from daily precipitation records of the nation along with data on the effects and impact of previous floods which will serve to train our machine learning model. This will help us predict the incoming flood well in advance and help us take the required precautionary measures.The local authorities can be alerted to warn the locals and help them evacuate if necessary.

We also plan on doing a terrain analysis to find out the low lying and flood prone areas.This will also help us detect the nearby safe locations to set up medical aid and rest areas. 
For prevention, we look for long term solutions. Through the terrain analysis we mark out areas that need more vegetation, or areas that are dangerous to set up residences in. Most cities in Tamilnadu and Kerala have residential areas set up in lowlands which were previously water bodies which make them extremely prone to floods. We hope to make the situation in these areas better over the long term. This information is also passed along to the government.

We plan to contribute to the damage control process that has to be carried out after a flood. Our predictive analysis of the flood gives us a good estimate of the intensity and expanse of the flood. We hence plan to produce a rough estimate of the relief budget, safest and most feasible areas to set us rescue and medical camps and identify most affected areas.

We also plan to expand our model in the future by coming up with a temporary and efficient mode of communication after the flood by setting up an ariel ad hoc network which will greatly aid the rescue mission.We are going to develop an app that serves as a source of the inferences of our analytics which include alerts, a list of the closest medical camps and more.This helps in reaching out to more people as well as teaching them rudimentary disaster management to help them reach their closest aid or rest camp. 

We plan to make our model simple and economical but also efficient so as to be able to implement it in an part of the country and hence try to make the country a safer place to live in.
